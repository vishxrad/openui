It currently supports two workflows:

- scaffolding a new OpenUI app from one of two templates:
  - **OpenUI Cloud (recommended)** — hosted models with managed conversations, streaming, built-in tools, and ready-to-use report and presentation artifacts
  - **Self-hosted** — bring an OpenAI-compatible model key and own the AI route and persistence
- keeping the default minimal SDK route or adding a LangGraph or Vercel AI SDK backend to either template
- generating a system prompt or JSON Schema from a `createLibrary()` export

## Install

Run the CLI with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest --help
pnpm dlx @openuidev/cli@latest --help
bunx @openuidev/cli@latest --help
```

## Quick Start

Create a new app (you'll be prompted to pick a template):

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create
```

Skip the prompt and pick a template directly:

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-cloud
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-self-hosted
```

Choose a backend framework directly (the default is `default`, the template's minimal SDK route):

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-cloud --backend-framework langgraph
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-cloud --backend-framework vercel-ai-sdk
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-self-hosted --backend-framework langgraph
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --template openui-self-hosted --backend-framework vercel-ai-sdk
```

Generate a prompt from a library file:

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest generate ./src/library.ts
```

Generate JSON Schema instead:

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest generate ./src/library.ts --json-schema
```

## Commands

### `openui create`

Scaffolds a new Next.js agent app from the recommended managed **OpenUI Cloud** template or the **self-hosted** template.

```bash
openui create [options]
```

Options:

- `-n, --name <string>`: Project name (interactive default: `openui-agent`)
- `-t, --template <template>`: AI backend — `openui-cloud` (managed) or `openui-self-hosted` (bring your provider)
- `--backend-framework <framework>`: API route implementation — `default`, `langgraph`, or `vercel-ai-sdk`
- `--skill`: Install the OpenUI agent skill for AI coding assistants
- `--no-skill`: Skip installing the OpenUI agent skill
- `--no-install`: Scaffold without running the package install
- `-i, --immediate`: Start the development server after installing dependencies; the CLI refuses to start when the template's required API key is unavailable
- `--no-immediate`: Install dependencies without starting the development server
- `--no-interactive`: Fail instead of prompting for missing required input
- `--api-key <key>`: (cloud template) OpenUI Cloud API key; skips sign-in
- `--auth <method>`: (cloud template) How to obtain the key — `oauth` or `skip`; `manual` remains available for backward compatibility but is deprecated
- `--agent-name <name>`: Declare the invoking coding agent as a lowercase kebab-case product slug (default: `unknown`)

`--immediate` and `--no-immediate` are mutually exclusive; passing both exits with an error.

What it does:

- prompts for the project name, defaulting to `openui-agent`, if you do not pass `--name`
- uses the `openui-cloud` template when you do not pass `--template` (interactive runs no longer ask; `--template openui-self-hosted` still works)
- prompts for a backend framework after the template; non-interactive usage defaults to `default`
- copies the bundled template into a new directory
- rewrites monorepo-local dependencies (`workspace:`, `file:`, `catalog:`) in the generated `package.json` to `latest`
- installs dependencies automatically using the detected package manager (unless `--no-install`)
- in interactive sessions, starts the development server and opens its local URL in the default browser; pass `--no-immediate` to install and exit instead
- in non-interactive sessions, installs and exits unless `--immediate` is passed
- optionally installs the OpenUI agent skill for AI coding assistants
- writes a `.env` file tailored to the template (see below)

#### Choose a backend

- **OpenUI Cloud (recommended default)** — start here for prototypes and evaluations. You get hosted models, managed conversation history and streaming, built-in tools, and ready-to-use report and presentation artifacts without operating the model, storage, or artifact infrastructure.
- **Self-hosted** — choose this when owning the OpenAI-compatible provider integration, AI route, and persistence is a requirement. It is not offered as an interactive choice; request it with `--template openui-self-hosted`.

#### Backend frameworks

| Value           | OpenUI Cloud route                           | Self-hosted route                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `default`       | Direct OpenAI SDK Responses proxy            | Direct OpenAI SDK Chat Completions proxy |
| `langgraph`     | LangGraph Agent Server + Cloud provider      | LangGraph Agent Server + your provider   |
| `vercel-ai-sdk` | Vercel AI SDK Next.js agent + Cloud provider | Vercel AI SDK `streamText()` route       |

The default implementation is part of each base template. For LangGraph or Vercel AI SDK, the CLI applies one backend overlay containing the final files plus a manifest for its dependencies, scripts, removals, and onboarding text. Both Vercel AI SDK variants are standard Next.js deployments whose `streamText()` result returns `toUIMessageStreamResponse()` for `vercelAIAdapter()`. Both LangGraph variants separate the Agent Server described by `langgraph.json` from the Next.js frontend/proxy. The proxy uses `@openuidev/langchain`, and the browser consumes its AG-UI stream with `agUIAdapter()`.

In both Cloud framework variants, the selected framework owns the agent orchestration and application tool loop. OpenUI Cloud is attached as the Responses model provider and conversation store. Reports, presentations, web search, image search, and configured MCP tools remain provider-executed Cloud tools, while application tools such as `get_weather` execute inside LangGraph or the Vercel AI SDK. Choosing a Cloud framework does not configure a user-owned model provider; choose `openui-self-hosted` for that.

For either generated LangGraph app, `pnpm dev` starts both Next.js and the local Agent Server. Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel, then point `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` at wherever the Agent Server runs. The Cloud graph needs `THESYS_API_KEY`; the self-hosted graph needs the selected provider credentials such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Every Cloud route includes `get_weather` as its example app-owned function tool. The LangGraph and Vercel AI SDK variants define and execute that tool through the selected framework while leaving Cloud-owned tools unchanged. The two self-hosted framework routes include the same weather example and run it through their native multi-step tool loops, making the selected backend directly testable after scaffolding.

#### Conversation storage

Every OpenUI Cloud variant uses OpenUI Cloud as its only durable conversation and artifact store. The browser connects directly through `useOpenuiCloudStorage()` with a short-lived frontend token, and `/api/chat` appends each turn to the same Cloud conversation with `conversation: threadId` and `store: true`. Vercel does not add a second store. The Cloud LangGraph relay creates a temporary Agent Server thread for each run and deletes it afterward; that thread is not the chat-history store. Configure a LangGraph checkpointer separately only when the graph itself needs durable state, interrupts, or resumable runs.

The self-hosted variants do not configure durable storage. `AgentInterface` keeps the conversation in memory for the current page session and sends that history to `/api/chat`; refreshing the page loses it. The self-hosted LangGraph relay also creates and deletes a temporary Agent Server thread for each run. Pass a storage implementation to `AgentInterface` and back it with your own database when persistence is required; add a LangGraph checkpointer only for graph-specific durable state.

#### Template-specific `.env`

- **OpenUI Cloud** — obtains an OpenUI Cloud API key and writes `THESYS_API_KEY` plus `DEMO_USER_ID=demo-user` to `.env`. The key is resolved by, in order:
  - `--api-key <key>` if provided
  - the `--auth` method, otherwise an interactive prompt offering:
    - `oauth` — sign in with Thesys in the browser and mint a key for your org
    - `skip` — leave `THESYS_API_KEY` empty and add it later (get one at <https://console.thesys.dev/keys>)
  - `--auth manual` is deprecated but remains available for backward compatibility; use `--api-key` for scripted setup instead
  - in non-interactive mode without `--api-key`, the cloud template fails because a key is required
- **Self-hosted** — prompts for your OpenAI-compatible provider API key and writes `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` (interactive mode only). Leave blank to skip.

Examples:

```bash
openui create
openui create --name my-app --template openui-self-hosted
openui create --name my-app --template openui-self-hosted --backend-framework langgraph
openui create --name my-app --template openui-self-hosted --backend-framework vercel-ai-sdk
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --auth oauth
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --backend-framework langgraph --auth oauth
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --backend-framework vercel-ai-sdk --auth oauth
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --api-key tk_your_key
openui create --name my-app --template openui-self-hosted
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --immediate
openui create --name my-app --template openui-cloud --no-immediate
openui create --name my-app --no-skill --no-install
openui create --no-interactive --name my-app --template openui-cloud --api-key tk_your_key
```

### `openui generate`

Generates a system prompt and serialized library spec from a file that exports a `createLibrary()` result. Use the spec with `generateSystemPrompt` in backend routes; the prompt file remains available for static or legacy integrations.

```bash
openui generate [options] [entry]
```

Arguments:

- `entry`: Path to a `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` file that exports a library

Options:

- `-o, --out <file>`: Write the prompt to a file and the spec alongside it with the extension replaced by `.spec.json`
- `--json-schema`: Output only JSON Schema instead of the prompt and spec
- `--spec`: Output only the serialized library spec
- `--export <name>`: Use a specific export name instead of auto-detecting the library export
- `--prompt-options <name>`: Use a specific `PromptOptions` export name (auto-detected by default)
- `--no-interactive`: Fail instead of prompting for a missing `entry`
- `--agent-name <name>`: Declare the invoking coding agent as a lowercase kebab-case product slug (default: `unknown`)

What it does:

- prompts for the entry file path if you do not pass one
- bundles the entry with `esbuild` before evaluating it in Node
- supports both TypeScript and JavaScript entry files
- stubs common asset imports such as CSS, SVG, images, and fonts during bundling
- auto-detects the exported library by checking `library`, `default`, and then all exports
- auto-detects a `PromptOptions` export (with `examples`, `additionalRules`, or `preamble`) and passes it to `library.prompt()`

Examples:

```bash
openui generate ./src/library.ts
openui generate ./src/library.ts --json-schema
openui generate ./src/library.ts --spec
openui generate ./src/library.ts --export library
openui generate ./src/library.ts --out ./artifacts/system-prompt.txt
openui generate ./src/library.ts --prompt-options myPromptOptions
openui generate --no-interactive ./src/library.ts
```

## How `generate` resolves exports

`openui generate` expects the target module to export a library object with `prompt()`, `toSpec()`, and `toJSONSchema()` methods.

If `--export` is not provided, it looks for exports in this order:

1. `library`
2. `default`
3. any other export that matches the expected library shape

### PromptOptions auto-detection

If `--prompt-options` is not provided, the CLI looks for a `PromptOptions` export in this order:

1. `promptOptions`
2. `options`
3. any export whose name ends with `PromptOptions` (case-insensitive)

A valid `PromptOptions` object has at least one of: `examples` (string array), `additionalRules` (string array), or `preamble` (string).

## Local Development

Build the CLI locally:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Run the built CLI:

```bash
node dist/index.js --help
node dist/index.js create --help
node dist/index.js generate --help
```

## Telemetry

The CLI sends usage analytics; OAuth sign-ins may link usage to your OIDC account ID. It does not send code, prompts, API keys, email, or personal names.

When a coding agent invokes the CLI, it should pass `--agent-name` using its stable, lowercase kebab-case product slug—for example, `codex`, `claude-code`, `cline`, `factory-droid`, or `pi`. Do not pass a model/version, user name, session ID, or other unique value. Humans can omit the flag; it defaults to `unknown`.

Telemetry includes both `agent_name` (the CLI declaration) and `detected_agent_name` (best-effort environment detection). Either can be spoofed, inherited, missing, or ambiguous; neither is an authentication signal. Every invocation gets an ephemeral, unpersisted `cli_run_id` so its events can be correlated. Failure events include bounded `failure_stage`, `error_class`, and `error_code` values, never raw error messages. Dependency failures distinguish peer, registry, network, install-script, workspace, and package-compatibility errors. Process failures include duration, exit code, and signal; Cloud-auth failures include a bounded auth substage and HTTP status when known; cancellations use separate events. For `create`, telemetry also includes `package_manager`, the immediate-start selection, and best-effort dev-command start and result events. Dev-command events contain status, duration, exit code, and signal—not project paths, command output, code, or environment values. Disable telemetry with `--no-telemetry` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

```bash
openui create --no-telemetry
```

## Notes

- interactive prompts can be cancelled without creating output
- `create` requires the selected template's files to be present in the built package
- `generate` exits with a non-zero code if the file is missing or no valid library export is found
